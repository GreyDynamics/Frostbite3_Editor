If the Resource Entry has a patchtype of 2,
it means it will get delta patched.

For patching, two files are required:
	Base -> block logic, defined by _baseSHA1
	Delta -> --NO-- block logic, defined by _deltaSHA1

	
The Delta file just has a 2 byte header:
	2 bytes (short, big_endian) -> Type
	
There a currently two known types:
	0x2000 -> It's using the following bytes with
			  a really nice algorithm, to patch the base
			  by adding bytes from delta or keeping bytes from base.
			  If bytes from base will be used, some bytes needs to be skipped.
			  
			  With this type, the delta header got extended by four more bytes:
				2 bytes (short, big_endian) -> proc Size
				2 bytes (short, big_endian) -> patched Size
			  
			  A replacement block contains:
			   - 2 bytes (short, big_endian) -> Offset
				 this value represents the offset inside the base,
				 if the return list is smaller as the offset, the
				 return list will be filled up to the offset.
			   - 1 byte -> Skip num bytes
			     If the return list got extended by some bytes from the delta file,
				 data from the base got "overridden", so we need to skip them.
			   - 1 byte -> Add num bytes
			     after filling up to the offset, bytes from the delta will get
				 added to the return list, this value is the number of following bytes
				 that get added. All bytes are located behind this value.
				 
				--->>This means the replacement header has a size of 4 bytes<<---
			  
			  After the delta file is done, all remaining bytes from base needs to be added
			  to the return list, to obtain the patched file.
			  
			  
	0x1000 -> This type is mostly used, if a lot of bytes that follow needs to be replaced
			  It's using multiple deltablocks, based on a header and the default block logic,
			  to add bytes from delta or keeping bytes from base.
			  If bytes from base will be used, some bytes needs to be skipped.
			  	  
			  With this type, the delta header got extended by two more bytes:
				2 bytes (short, big_endian) -> number of deltablocks
			
			  Each deltablock has a 4 byte header, followed by the logic block:
				- 2 bytes (short, big_endian) -> Offset
				 this value represents the offset inside the base,
				 if the return list is smaller as the offset, the
				 return list will be filled up to the offset.
				- 2 bytes (short, big_endian) -> Skip num bytes
			     If the return list got extended by some bytes from the delta file,
				 data from the base got "overridden", so we need to skip them.
				- The logic block.
				
				
			  To obtain the total length of the logic block to find out where it ends
			  and the next deltablock starts, we need the compressed length from the
			  compressed logic block, so we have to seek 6 bytes forward to read the value
			  and go 8 bytes back to get the starting point of the block.
			  
			  The logic block, need to be decompressed from the current offset,
			  with a total length of the obtained compressed size + adding the length
			  the block logic's header (8 bytes). See "../compression/lz4.txt" for more detail!
			  
			  --->>Conclusion: this type is using compressed blocks, instead of 0x1000's following bytes<<---
